# rust-demo
highlights of what I think are great about rust; I will add/share them as I remember as well as I learn...

- nested_lamdas - a simple demonstrations to use loops and lambda results to step into inner loops and lambdas; a very nice concept especially for treating Option<T> None as 0 and Option<T> Some as 1 element of an array.  This sample includes map() and fold() as well, to represent that you can reduce all the if and match into just 1 line
